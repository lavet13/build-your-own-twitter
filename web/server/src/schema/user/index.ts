 * User feature loader

 * This file ONLY imports schema definitions to register them with the builder.
 * It does NOT export anything (following Pothos best practices).

 * If you need to import the User type elsewhere, import directly from schema.ts:
 * import { UserNode } from "@/schema/user/schema"
